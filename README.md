# MVCNet

This repository hosts the implementation of **Multi-View Contrastive Network (MVCNet) for Motor Imagery Classification**.

The source code, along with baselines and the proposed MVCNet, will be released upon formal acceptance.

MVCNet combines multi-view data augmentation, dual-branch (CNN and Transformer) modeling, and supervised contrastive learning to enhance EEG representation learning and decoding generalizability.

We appreciate your interest and patience.
